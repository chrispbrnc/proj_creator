This software should have a License at a later date, but for now, 
it is assumed that the License should follow that of SeisUP (R). 

The SeisUP Project Creator software is under development by  

>	Chris Branca  
>	Cory Robinson  

both of whom are Processing Geophysicist working in Seimax Technologies LP
production team. Cory is the administrator for the production code
repository, and will be managing releases of production code.

The software is meant to provide as much automation as possible for the
process of creating a new project in SeisUP, such that the processor can
simply navigate to the newly created project within SeisUP, and immediatly
start running process flows.  

Getting Started
---------------

If you've gotten this far, then you know the software lives in the:

	/mnt/gz4/home/supprojectcreator/

directory. For now, you can run the software by navigating to the

	/mnt/gz4/home/supprojectcreator/src/

directory, and then executing

	python main.py

in your terminal. In it's current state, this program will run with your
Mac's default Python 2.7.11 distribution.
